A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 
The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.
Sorting refers to rearrangement of a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.
The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure. 
Sorting means reordering of all the elements either in ascending or in descending order.

Applications of Sorting Algorithms:

Searching Algorithms: 
Sorting is often a crucial step in search algorithms like binary search, Ternary Search, where the data needs to be sorted before searching for a specific element.

Data management: 
Sorting data makes it easier to search, retrieve, and analyze.

Database optimization: 
Sorting data in databases improves query performance.

Machine learning: 
Sorting is used to prepare data for training machine learning models.

Data Analysis: 
Sorting helps in identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in datasets. It plays a vital role in statistical analysis, financial modeling, and other data-driven fields.

Operating Systems: 
Sorting algorithms are used in operating systems for tasks like task scheduling, memory management, and file system organization.
